# simple-chess-c--windows-forms
application on c # to play chess

To start the application go to "projectChess/bin/Debug/" and run projectChess.exe

I wrote in visual studio 2017, so to see the code, run the file "projectChess.sln" in visual studio.

The application has a bug that I could not fix. If you go wrong by the rules, the application will get bogged down, you also cannot cancel the move.
